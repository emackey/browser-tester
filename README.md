# browser-tester README

Testing a bug.  Compile and run this VSCode extension, then hit CTRL-SHIFT-P and type `hello world` to execute the Hello World task.  An HTML webview will appear with a hit-test box in the upper right.  Hovering should turn green, clicking should turn orange.  Ideally, all parts of the hit test box should work.
